# 🚀 How to Start & Use with Cursor Chat

## ⚠️ Important: How It Works

**The extension does NOT automatically check prompts as you type in Cursor's chat box** because Cursor doesn't expose APIs for extensions to hook into the chat interface.

**BUT** - We've made it super easy to use with Cursor chat! Here's how:

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps!)

### Step 1: Start the Extension

1. **Open the `prompt-assistant` folder** in Cursor
2. **Press `F5`** (or Run → Start Debugging)
3. **A new window opens** - that's your Extension Development Host
4. **The extension is now active!** Look for the "✨ Improve Prompt" button in the status bar (bottom right)

### Step 2: Use with Cursor Chat

**Super Easy Workflow:**

1. **Type your prompt** in Cursor's AI chat box (the normal chat)
2. **Select the text** you typed (or select all with `Ctrl+A`)
3. **Copy it** (`Ctrl+C`)
4. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+M`** (or click the status bar button)
5. **Get ML-powered recommendations!**
6. **Copy the improved prompt** and paste it back into Cursor chat

### Step 3: Enjoy Better Prompts!

The ML advisor will:
- ✅ Detect your goal
- ✅ Recommend the best model
- ✅ Suggest optimal parameters
- ✅ Tell you what context to provide
- ✅ Fill in missing parts
- ✅ Give you an iteration strategy
- ✅ Provide a verification checklist

## 🔍 What You'll See

When you press `Ctrl+Shift+M`, you'll get a panel showing:

- **🎯 Goal**: "Debugging" (detected automatically)
- **🤖 Model**: "GPT-4" (recommended for your task)
- **🌡️ Temperature**: 0.1 (optimal setting)
- **📋 Context Needed**: Error message, code file, environment
- **📝 Format**: Structured (Problem → Solution → Code)
- **✨ Enhanced Prompt**: Complete prompt with missing parts filled
- **🔄 Iteration Plan**: Step-by-step refinement strategy
- **✅ Checklist**: What to verify in the response

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Extension not starting?**
- Make sure you're in the `prompt-assistant` folder
- Press `F5` to start
- Check Output panel for errors

**Commands not working?**
- Make sure you're in the Extension Development Host window (the new window that opened)
- The extension only works in that window, not the original Cursor window

**Status bar button missing?**
- Reload the Extension Development Host window (`Ctrl+R`)
- Check if extension activated (look in Output panel)

**Want it to work automatically?**
- Unfortunately, Cursor doesn't allow extensions to hook into the chat interface
- But the `Ctrl+Shift+M` workflow is super fast and gives you control!

## 📝 Summary

1. **Start**: Press `F5` in the `prompt-assistant` folder
2. **Use**: Type in Cursor chat → Copy → `Ctrl+Shift+M` → Copy improved → Paste
3. **Enjoy**: Better prompts = Better AI responses!

**Ready? Press F5 now, then try `Ctrl+Shift+M` with any prompt!** 🚀

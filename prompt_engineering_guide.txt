PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDE
========================

This guide contains best practices, frameworks, and tips for creating effective prompts.
Use this as a reference when crafting prompts for AI assistants.

CORE PRINCIPLES
---------------

1. BE SPECIFIC AND CLEAR
   - Clearly state what you want
   - Avoid ambiguity
   - Use precise language
   - Define technical terms if needed

2. KEEP IT CONCRETE, NOT CONTINUOUS
   - Use discrete, actionable steps rather than abstract flows
   - Break tasks into specific, measurable chunks
   - Avoid vague, continuous descriptions
   - Prefer "do X, then Y, then Z" over "work on this generally"
   - Make each step independently verifiable
   - Use concrete examples and specific outputs
   
   Example (Continuous/Bad):
   "Improve the code quality and make it better"
   
   Example (Concrete/Good):
   "1. Add type hints to all function parameters
    2. Extract magic numbers into named constants
    3. Add docstrings following Google style
    4. Split the 200-line function into 3 smaller functions"

3. PROVIDE CONTEXT
   - Include relevant background information
   - Explain the problem domain
   - Mention constraints or requirements
   - Share relevant examples or patterns

4. STRUCTURE YOUR PROMPT
   - Use clear sections (Task, Context, Requirements, Output Format)
   - Break complex requests into discrete steps
   - Use formatting (bullets, numbered lists, code blocks)
   - Make each section independently actionable

5. INCLUDE EXAMPLES
   - Show what good output looks like
   - Provide sample inputs/outputs
   - Demonstrate edge cases
   - Use concrete, specific examples

6. ITERATE AND REFINE
   - Start broad, then narrow down
   - Test different phrasings
   - Learn from what works

PROMPT STRUCTURE FRAMEWORKS
---------------------------

FRAMEWORK 1: Role-Context-Task-Format (RCTF)
---------------------------------------------
[Role] You are a [specific role/expertise]
[Context] Working on [project/domain] where [background info]
[Task] [Specific action to perform]
[Format] Output should be [format requirements]

Example:
"You are a senior Python developer working on a web scraping project 
that needs to handle rate limiting. Create a function that implements 
exponential backoff. Output should be production-ready code with docstrings."

FRAMEWORK 2: Situation-Task-Action-Result (STAR)
-------------------------------------------------
[Situation] Describe the current state
[Task] What needs to be accomplished
[Action] Specific steps or approach
[Result] Expected outcome or format

FRAMEWORK 3: Chain-of-Thought
-----------------------------
Break complex problems into steps:
1. First, analyze...
2. Then, identify...
3. Next, create...
4. Finally, verify...

COMMON PROMPT PATTERNS
----------------------

PATTERN 1: Code Generation
---------------------------
- Specify language and version
- Include requirements/constraints
- Mention style preferences
- Request error handling
- Ask for comments/docstrings

Example:
"Write a Python 3.10 function that:
- Takes a list of dictionaries
- Filters items where 'status' == 'active'
- Returns sorted by 'priority' (descending)
- Includes type hints and error handling
- Add docstring with examples"

PATTERN 2: Code Review/Refactoring
-----------------------------------
- Point to specific code sections
- Mention concerns (performance, readability, security)
- Request specific improvements
- Ask for explanations

Example:
"Review this function for performance issues. Focus on:
- Time complexity
- Memory usage
- Potential bottlenecks
Suggest optimizations with explanations."

PATTERN 3: Problem Solving
--------------------------
- Describe the problem clearly
- Include constraints
- Specify success criteria
- Request multiple approaches if needed

PATTERN 4: Explanation/Teaching
-------------------------------
- Specify audience level
- Request analogies or examples
- Ask for step-by-step breakdown
- Include common pitfalls

Example:
"Explain [concept] to a beginner. Use:
- Simple analogies
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Code examples
- Common mistakes to avoid"

PATTERN 5: Debugging
--------------------
- Include error messages
- Show relevant code
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Mention environment details

BEST PRACTICES
--------------

DO:
✓ Be specific about what you want
✓ Keep prompts concrete and discrete (not abstract/continuous)
✓ Break tasks into independently actionable steps
✓ Provide relevant context and background
✓ Use examples to illustrate your needs
✓ Break complex tasks into smaller parts
✓ Specify output format (code, markdown, JSON, etc.)
✓ Mention constraints (time, space, style)
✓ Ask for explanations when needed
✓ Request alternatives or trade-offs
✓ Include edge cases to consider
✓ Make each requirement independently verifiable

DON'T:
✗ Be vague or ambiguous
✗ Use abstract, continuous descriptions ("improve things generally")
✗ Assume the AI knows your project context
✗ Ask for everything at once (break it down)
✗ Forget to specify format requirements
✗ Skip important constraints
✗ Use jargon without explanation
✗ Ask for impossible or contradictory things
✗ Use flowing, theoretical language when concrete steps are needed

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
-------------------

1. FEW-SHOT LEARNING
   Provide 2-3 examples of input/output pairs:
   "Here are examples:
   Input: [example 1]
   Output: [example 1]
   
   Input: [example 2]
   Output: [example 2]
   
   Now process: [your input]"

2. STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
   Ask the AI to show its thinking:
   "Think step by step. First explain your approach, 
   then provide the solution."

3. CONSTRAINTS AND REQUIREMENTS
   Be explicit about limitations:
   - "Must work with Python 3.8+"
   - "No external dependencies"
   - "Must be under 50 lines"
   - "Follow PEP 8 style guide"

4. ITERATIVE REFINEMENT
   Start broad, then narrow:
   Round 1: "Create a function to process data"
   Round 2: "Add error handling and logging"
   Round 3: "Optimize for performance"

5. ROLE PLAYING
   Assign a specific role:
   "You are a security expert reviewing this code..."
   "Act as a code reviewer with 10 years experience..."

6. OUTPUT FORMATTING
   Specify exact format:
   - "Return JSON with keys: name, age, email"
   - "Use markdown with headers"
   - "Provide as a table"
   - "Include code comments"

COMMON PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------

WEAK PROMPT:
"Fix my code"

STRONG PROMPT:
"I have a Python function that's throwing a TypeError. 
The function processes user input and should return a 
dictionary. Here's the code: [code]. The error occurs 
when [specific scenario]. Please identify the issue, 
explain why it happens, and provide a fix with 
error handling."

WEAK PROMPT:
"Make it faster"

STRONG PROMPT:
"Optimize this function for performance. Current 
execution time is ~500ms for 10,000 items. Target 
is <100ms. Focus on algorithmic improvements. 
The function: [code]. Maintain the same output format."

WEAK PROMPT:
"Explain this"

STRONG PROMPT:
"Explain how this React hook works to someone new 
to React hooks. Break down: [code]. Include:
- What each part does
- Why it's structured this way
- How to use it
- Common mistakes"

WEAK PROMPT (Continuous/Abstract):
"Refactor this codebase to be cleaner and more maintainable"

STRONG PROMPT (Concrete/Discrete):
"Refactor this codebase with these specific steps:
1. Extract all hardcoded strings into a constants file
2. Split the 500-line service class into 5 focused classes
3. Add unit tests for the 3 core business logic functions
4. Replace all 'any' types with proper TypeScript interfaces
5. Add error handling to all async operations
Start with step 1 and show the changes."

PROMPT CHECKLIST
----------------

Before sending your prompt, check:
□ Is my request clear and specific?
□ Is it concrete/discrete rather than abstract/continuous?
□ Can each step be independently verified?
□ Have I provided enough context?
□ Are my requirements explicit?
□ Have I specified the output format?
□ Did I include relevant examples?
□ Are constraints clearly stated?
□ Is the task broken into manageable parts?
□ Have I mentioned any style preferences?
□ Did I include error cases or edge cases?

WORKING WITH THIS GUIDE
-----------------------

When crafting prompts:
1. Review relevant sections above

3. Use a template as a starting point
4. Customize for your specific needs
5. Include all relevant context
6. Specify output format
7. Iterate based on results

You can reference this guide when working with AI assistants:
- "Using the RCTF framework, help me..."
- "Following the code generation pattern, create..."
- "Based on the best practices, review..."

Remember: Good prompts are iterative. Start with a draft, 
test it, and refine based on the results.
